# hello-world

My name is Deyrel Diaz. I am an up and coming professional coder. 
I am currently in school and looking for a summer internship to further expand my programming knowledge. 
I am a software engineering major and am eager to learn new things. 
Augmented reality really excites me; it reminds me of iron man capabilities. 
Making runnable programs come to life from what started as an idea, really fascinates me. 
God, family, and health are the most important things to me. 
I believe in a balanced life and that everything you do in life is connected to other parts. 
For example, being a good brother or son, can directly relate to being a good friend or employee. 
If I am passoinate about something, I am the hardest worker you will ever meet!
